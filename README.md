# The Magical Bot
Welcome to The Magical Bot of Hogwarts, the one and only bot that gives you all the information you need about the side characters!
Let's get to know The Magical Bot better now ✈

★ The Magical Bot(TMB) is trained to detect most of the side characters from the Harry Poteer movies.

★ TMB does not stop here of course and it gives you all the info you might need with explaining the connections between other characters with side characters. Brilliant, right?


✵ TMB uses a model from Google Teacheable Machine that is trained by TMB's creator.

✵ TMB is capable of detecting a character from many angles since it's model was trained with a variety of photos.

✵ This model was later transfered to Visual Studio Code where it became a code for discord bots.
